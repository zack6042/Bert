# BERT for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to perform sentiment analysis on an Arabic dataset. BERT, developed by Google, has proven to be revolutionary in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its deep understanding of language contexts.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses the BERT model to classify sentiments in Arabic text.
- **Dataset:** Analysis performed on a specially curated Arabic dataset suited for sentiment classification.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned for Arabic language text.

## Access the Notebook
The entire implementation is available in a Google Colab notebook, which can be accessed through the following link:
- [Sentiment Analysis using BERT on Arabic Dataset Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UhfeASCUOlxBFyouJQAjMUemXg_Mx184?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started
To run and interact with the notebook:
1. Click on the link above to open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. To run the notebook, click on `Runtime` in the Colab menu and select `Run all`.
3. To make changes or try different parameters, you can edit the code cells directly in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
- Google account to access Google Colab.
- Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.

## Usage
The notebook is self-contained and includes both the dataset and the pre-trained BERT model. Here are the steps to follow for using the notebook:
1. Open the notebook using the provided link.
2. Review the initial setup sections which import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
3. Proceed through the notebook sections, executing each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.
4. Optional: Adjust hyperparameters or modify the sections to experiment with different training approaches.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are always welcome. Potential areas for contribution include:
- Enhancing the model's performance.
- Expanding the dataset with more varied examples.
- Improving the notebook's explanations or adding more visualization.
